# LeetCode

This is my Repository for various LeetCode exercises.

I decided that it would be helpful to compile a list of all my problems from 12/22/22 on out.

## General information for running the code

### C

To run a C program, use the following command:

```bash
gcc <problem_file>.c -o <problem_file>.o && ./<problem_file>.o
```

### C++

Similar to C, but use g++ instead:

```bash
g++ <problem_file>.cpp -o <problem_file>.o && ./<problem_file>.o
```

### C\#

To run a C# program, use the following command:

```bash
dotnet-script <problem_file>.cs
```

### Go

To run a Go program, use the following command:

```bash
go run <problem_file>.go
```

### Java

To run a Java program, use the following commands:

```bash
javac <problem_file>.java
java <problem_file>
```

### JavaScript

To run a JavaScript program, use the following command:

```bash
node <problem_file>.js
```

### Python

Typically there will be a .venv folder in the problem directory. If not, then just use a global instance.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 <problem_file>.py
```

### Rust

To run a Rust program, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --quiet
```

### TypeScript

To run a TypeScript program, use the following command:

```bash
tsx <problem_file>.ts
```

## Other (Future Languages to Possibly Add)

List of languages allowed on LeetCode:

- C++
- Java
- Python
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- C#
- C
- Go
- Kotlin
- Swift*
- Rust
- Ruby*
- PHP*
- Dart
- Scala*
- Elixir*
- Erlang*
- Racket*

Any languages marked with an asterisk (*) are languages that I have extremely limited or no experience with. Any that are in this list but not mentioned in the "General information for running the code" section are languages that I have learned a little bit, but not enough to feel comfortable solving LeetCode problems in them.
